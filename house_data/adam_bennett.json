The garden and back garden is meticulously looked after by her personally, and she is always there to help out when we have a query about anything in the house (answering the phone at all hours when we have a problem). The home is equipped with everything we could possibly need, even home luxuries are provided. We are all very happy with her service and will recommend her to future students looking to rent.<br\/><br\/>\rCaroline and Graham were great - always there whenever we needed them. Only had to ask and they would be at our doorstep! Really couldn't do enough for us. House was lovely too, a great standard!<br\/><br\/>\rCaroline made moving into our accommodation very simple as she helped us every step of the way and was always free to answer questions. She is very friendly and never lets us feel like we can't ask her for help.<br\/><br\/>\rReally friendly, helpful and reliable. I feel I can approach her if there is a problem. She mowed the grass outside our which was nice. Everything in the house was working well when I moved in and the rooms were furnished nicely.<br\/><br\/>\rShe's really nice to us and comes round whenever we have a problem; for instance, when we had a blocked toilet she had someone round to check it within hours. Our house is nicely furnished and we feel very safe living here.<br\/><br\/>\rCaroline was an absolute joy to have as a landlady. She has a lovely bubbly personality and is very easy to get along with. When we moved in all the rooms were absolutely spotless, and all facilities were in working order. If anything ever broke she would have someone round to sort it out in the same day. For example one day the washing machine stopped working and her husband came and fixed it within an hour. She even gave us free tickets to a pantomime she was directing once. The house was of a very high standard for students, with a great location and the rent was a very reasonable price.<br\/><br\/>\rCaroline is a truly wonderful landlord. It was my first time ever renting a property and I was a bit nervous living off-campus for the first time. We visited a few properties and they either seemed a bit worn down or the landlord was a bit aloof or dismissive of us (maybe they'd had bad experiences with students in the past). Caroline came over to greet us when we first visited Redbarn, and the moment I met her, I felt so relieved. She was so warm, friendly and enthusiastic. And, the property was stunning! It was immaculately clean, beautifully furnished, and everything felt new and taken care of. Caroline showed us the entire house with such detail and care, and asked us if there was anything she could to to make us more comfortable. I immediately felt at home and excited to be living at Redbarn! I lived with three rugby players and, though they meant well, did not care for the house as well as it deserved to be treated. Caroline was so patient and kind with us! She bought us extra cleaning supplies and made sure we had everything we needed. I could not recommend Caroline highly enough! While other landlords seemed to dismiss us as naive students, Caroline treated us with respect, as professional clients. She is a truly wonderful, conscientious Landlord and person, and I am so glad to be given this opportunity to vote for her!<br\/><br\/>\rContinue as you are being so helpful and friendly. You made us feel so at ease in the house and we couldn't have hoped for better Landlords!  The house was amazing, well kept, beautiful and homely thank you for an amazing year. You have been the best Landlady and all the best for the future - katie Rating: Completley satisfied 100 %<br\/>\rps<br\/>\rThank you for all your help!  You have been the best Landlords and Redbarn Drive has been the loveliest home. I am still in York for this next year so please call if I can help in the tenant hunting.

    "long_description": "VOTED LANDLORD OF THE YEAR 2014  this is what our previous Tenants said about us.........<br\/><br\/>\rWe have been made to feel very at home and the house is in fantastic condition. She has been very sympathetic to the fact we are students and has accommodated us in every way possible. The garden and back garden is meticulously looked after by her personally, and she is always there to help out when we have a query about anything in the house (answering the phone at all hours when we have a problem). The home is equipped with everything we could possibly need, even home luxuries are provided. We are all very happy with her service and will recommend her to future students looking to rent.<br\/><br\/>\rCaroline and Graham were great - always there whenever we needed them. Only had to ask and they would be at our doorstep! Really couldn't do enough for us. House was lovely too, a great standard!<br\/><br\/>\rCaroline made moving into our accommodation very simple as she helped us every step of the way and was always free to answer questions. She is very friendly and never lets us feel like we can't ask her for help.<br\/><br\/>\rReally friendly, helpful and reliable. I feel I can approach her if there is a problem. She mowed the grass outside our which was nice. Everything in the house was working well when I moved in and the rooms were furnished nicely.<br\/><br\/>\rShe's really nice to us and comes round whenever we have a problem; for instance, when we had a blocked toilet she had someone round to check it within 24 hours. Our house is nicely furnished and we feel very safe living here.<br\/><br\/>\rCaroline was an absolute joy to have as a landlady. She has a lovely bubbly personality and is very easy to get along with. When we moved in all the rooms were absolutely spotless, and all facilities were in working order. If anything ever broke she would have someone round to sort it out in the same day. For example one day the washing machine stopped working and her husband came and fixed it within an hour. She even gave us free tickets to a pantomime she was directing once. The house was of a very high standard for students, with a great location and the rent was a very reasonable price.<br\/><br\/>\rCaroline is a truly wonderful landlord. It was my first time ever renting a property and I was a bit nervous living off-campus for the first time. We visited a few properties and they either seemed a bit worn down or the landlord was a bit aloof or dismissive of us (maybe they'd had bad experiences with students in the past). Caroline came over to greet us when we first visited Redbarn, and the moment I met her, I felt so relieved. She was so warm, friendly and enthusiastic. And, the property was stunning! It was immaculately clean, beautifully furnished, and everything felt new and taken care of. Caroline showed us the entire house with such detail and care, and asked us if there was anything she could to to make us more comfortable. I immediately felt at home and excited to be living at Redbarn! I lived with three rugby players and, though they meant well, did not care for the house as well as it deserved to be treated. Caroline was so patient and kind with us! She bought us extra cleaning supplies and made sure we had everything we needed. I could not recommend Caroline highly enough! While other landlords seemed to dismiss us as naive students, Caroline treated us with respect, as professional clients. She is a truly wonderful, conscientious landlord and person, and I am so glad to be given this opportunity to vote for her!<br\/><br\/>\rAndrew<br\/>\r I have THOROUGHLY enjoyed living here and as far as student properties go it has been a palace in comparison to anything else I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen. Caroline is a conscientious and professional Landlady and a genuinely lovely person.  I would have NO hesitation in recommending her. Any student in their right mind would snatch your hand off to live here!  Thanks Caroline all the best for the future! Andy<br\/>\rCompletely satisfied 100 % <br\/><br\/>\rJames <br\/>\rThe year I have spent at Redbarn Drive has been faultless - \u00e2\u0080\u009cfantastic\u00e2\u0080\u009d! Cheers for being an ACE Landlady Caroline!!! Completely satisfied 100% <br\/><br\/>\rNatalie <br\/>\rYou have been so helpful this year! It is quite scary moving into a house for the first time but anytime that you been asked for help you have given it.  It is very reassuring knowing that you care.  Everything was perfect!  Thanks again for the past year, you have both been fantastic and so helpful since it was our first time in a rented house. It really was a lovely house and we all had a fantastic year, you never know, we may rent off you again next year since we will all be back in York - thanks again Natalie Completely satisfied 100% <br\/><br\/>\rDeanne <br\/>\rThanks so much! A really nice house and really helpful owners made my year at University much easier thank you - I think everything this last year was brilliant! <br\/>\rCompletely satisfied 100% <br\/><br\/>\rDon't delay book YOUR viewing TODAY and see for yourself<br\/><br\/>\r* VISIT OUR FACEBOOK PAGE* - Domus Letting",
